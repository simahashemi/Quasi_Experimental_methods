# Quasi-Experimental Methods

This repository contains Python-based implementations and illustrative examples of key **quasi-experimental methods** used in causal inference. These methods are especially useful when randomized controlled trials are not feasible, and researchers must rely on observational data to estimate causal effects.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Quasi-experimental methods help evaluate the impact of interventions or treatments while accounting for potential confounders. The repository includes code and explanations for the following methods:

- âœ… Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- âœ… Interrupted Time Series (ITS)
- âœ… Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
- âœ… Instrumental Variables (IV)
- âœ… Propensity Score Matching (PSM)

Each method is implemented with simple, well-commented code to demonstrate how it works in practice, often using real or simulated data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases

These methods are commonly used in fields like:

- Public policy evaluation  
- Health economics  
- Education research  
- Epidemiology  
- Social sciences
